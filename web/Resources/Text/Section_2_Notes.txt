JavaScript shiv
The JavaScript shiv lets older browsers know about the elements
<script src = "http://html5shiv.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/html5.js"></script>
Include this script element that runs a javascript shiv that tells the browser that the semantic elements are being used.

Before using CSS to format the semantic elements in older browsers set CSS rule.
article, aside, figure, figcaption, footer, header, nav, section {
    display: block;
}
Without this older browsers may treat the items as inline elements.
